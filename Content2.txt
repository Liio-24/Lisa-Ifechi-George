My name is Lisa Ifechi George. I am a 23 year old medical student at University of Uyo.
I am from Ihiala LGA in Anambra state.
I want to be a good Technical writer just like my Mentor, Funke.
I almost gave up trying to set up this whole thing, but I realized that Perseverance is key to becoming very good at anything.
This is the beginning of my Amazing Journey.
Thank you Techrity.
At this point, I don't know what I am doing. Funke Help me oh.
At this point, all is well that ends well. Trying to create a diffrent content.
